                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Sushi, that you'll know to be raw fish and rice and a Japanese cuisine
                    can be made of any meat and vegetables but most commonly with seafood. Variations
                    of shushi are also eaten in KOrea, Thailand and Malaysia. The rice is stored for months 
                    at a time or sometimes just weeks now that sushi has evolved.
                </p>
                <p>Nevertheless, in modern times, sushi is described as a Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring"
